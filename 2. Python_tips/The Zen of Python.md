<H2>The Zen of Python</H2>
- Beautiful is better than ugly.<BR>
- Explicit is better than implicit.<BR>
- Simple is better than complex.<BR>
- Complex is better than complicated.<BR>
- Flat is better than nested.<BR>
- Sparse is better than dense.<BR>
- Readability counts.<BR>
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<BR>
- Although practicality beats purity.<BR>
- Errors should never pass silently.<BR>
- Unless explicitly silenced.<BR>
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<BR>
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<BR>
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<BR>
- Now is better than never.<BR>
- Although never is often better than *right* now.<BR>
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<BR>
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<BR>
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<BR><BR>
